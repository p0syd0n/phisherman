creates phishing pages for you!!

only works with pages that have an action='' thing for logging in.

when it asks you what you want to save the file as, 'h' for .html 't' for .txt and anything else for a .php files

installations:
```
pip install colorama
```
for the colors

idk about the re module, too lazy to check

lots of bugs, but keep in mind this was written in 50 minutes and uploaded right after- its not perfect

make an issue if something goes wrong
